   This section provides an overview over the system architecture and
briefly describes each software component.

   System architecture
  </h2>
        <p>
   The following diagram describes the typical system architecture the
Signavio Process Manager is embedded in together with third-party
software such as web servers, web browsers and databases.
  </p>
        <p>
   By default, the On Premise Edition contains the components
highlighted in red, components or interfaces highlighted in yellow can
be purchased separately.

   Signavio Collaboration
Hub  </h3>
        <p>
   The front end of Collaboration Hub runs a JavaScript engine from a web browser. It provides read-only access to
published diagrams. Collaboration Hub grants read-only access to every
user who is able to access the server of Signavio Process Manager.
Collaboration Hub can be linked to an Active Directory service to
enable single-sign-on authentication. Moreover, the active directory
integration allows you to define detailed diagram access rights for
Collaboration Hub users.
  </p>
        <p>
   Signavio Collaboration Hub supports all of the following web browsers: <a href="https://www.signavio.com/browser-compatibility/" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">https://www.signavio.com/browser-compatibility/</a>.
  </p>
        <h3 id="signavio-process-manager-javascript" name="signavio-process-manager-javascript">
   Signavio Process Manager  </h3>
        <p>
   The front end runs JavaScript and is entirely accessible through the
web browser.
  </p>
        <p>
   A user must be registered with a valid email address and a
self-chosen password to get access to the Signavio Editor, Explorer or
Dictionary.
  </p>
        <h3 id="signavio-process-manager-web-application" name="signavio-process-manager-web-application">
   Signavio Process
Manager  </h3>
        <p>
   The back end logic runs in the Tomcat runtime environment as a Java
application.
  </p>
        <h3 id="jdbc-connector" name="jdbc-connector">
   JDBC Connector
  </h3>
        <p>
   Access to the database system is implemented with JDBC. An adapter
must be downloaded from the website of the respective vendor (see <MadCap:xref href="installation/install-jdbc-driver.htm">   Installing the JDBC driver</MadCap:xref>).
  </p>
        <h3 id="web-browser" name="web-browser">
   Web browser
  </h3>
        <p>
   The Signavio front end can be accessed via a web browser. Find all supported web browsers listed on <a href="https://www.signavio.com/browser-compatibility/" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">https://www.signavio.com/browser-compatibility/</a>.  </p>
        <h3 id="apache-tomcat" name="apache-tomcat">
   Apache Tomcat
  </h3>
        <p>
   The application server represents the runtime environment for the
Java back end. The system requirements mention the <a href="installation/system-requirements.htm#Soft" title="currently supported Tomcat&#xA; version(s)" alt="currently supported Tomcat&#xA; version(s)" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">currently supported Tomcat
 version(s)</a>. For managing user sessions Signavio Process Manager
uses the native Tomcat session mechanism. Such sessions are stored in
the servers file system, so that they are kept even if the Tomcat
application server is shut down. Therefore, a restart or a temporary
unavailability of the Tomcat server is invisible to the user.
  </p>
        <p>
   Furthermore, no constant connection to the back end is required for
modeling in the front end (except for saving, loading or dictionary
lookups). This basically implies that the back end can be shut down
while users are still modeling. If the Tomcat server is available again
in time, no user will recognize it. Signavio Collaboration Hub is not accessible
during a shut down.
  </p>
        <p>
   HTTP or HTTPS (SSL) can be chosen for the connection between a web
browser and the Tomcat server.
  </p>
        <h3 id="mail-server-smtp" name="mail-server-smtp">
   Mail server  </h3>
        <p>
   The mail server can be any server that is accessible via SMTP.
  </p>
        <h3 id="database-system" name="database-system">
   Database system
  </h3>
        <p>
   The database contains Signavio Process Manager’s user data. The data
is stored using a UTF-8 character set. The system requirements contain
a list of all supported database systems.
  </p>
        <h3 id="active-directory" name="active-directory">
   Active Directory
  </h3>
        <p>
   Signavio Collaboration Hub can be integrated with your Active
Directory service. User and user group information stored in the Active
Directory are used only to control read-only access to Collaboration
Hub. Again, modeling access rights are decoupled from the Active
Directory as they are managed from within Signavio Process Manager.
  </p>
        <div class="important" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Important&lt;/b&gt;">
            <p>
    When linking to an Active Directory using <strong>Kerberos</strong>
    as the authentication protocol, the Signavio server has to be installed
on Windows 64 bit and must belong to the domain whose Active Directory
needs to be accessed.
   </p>
        </div>
        <h3 id="sharepoint-portal" name="sharepoint-portal">
   SharePoint portal
  </h3>
        <p>
   Optionally, Signavio offers a SharePoint Web Part as a WSP package.
The package provides seamless front end integration for the read-only
access to the SharePoint portal. The look and feel of Signavio
Collaboration Hub can be customized easily via the Web Part.
  </p>
        <h3 id="third-party-system" name="third-party-system">
   Third-party system
  </h3>
        <p>
   Third-party systems (e.g. a ticket tracking system), can be
connected with a separately licensed API.

   Signavio Workflow
Accelerator
  </h3>
        <p>
   Signavio Workflow Accelerator is a workflow automation system that
is required for using the “approval workflow” feature. Signavio
provides the software to customers who purchased a corresponding
subscription. The back end is a Java web application that has to be
installed on a separate server. Signavio Workflow Accelerator requires
Oracle Java 8, Apache Tomcat 7 or 8 and MongoDB 3.4 or 3.6. Refer to the <MadCap:xref href="../../workflow-accelerator/adminguide/intro/intro.htm">
