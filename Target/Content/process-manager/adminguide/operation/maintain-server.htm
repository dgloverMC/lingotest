   Maintaining the server
  </h1>
        <p>
   When you need to restart the system - for example because of an
update - consider the following issues.
  </p>
        <h2 id="inform-your-users" name="inform-your-users">
   Inform your users
  </h2>
        <p>
   If maintenance activities require a restart of the system, inform
all users that the server is temporarily unavailable.
  </p>
        <p>
   As a workspace administrator of Signavio Process Manager you can
access a list of all users to inform them about updates and possible
downtimes.
  </p>
        <h2 id="managing-the-database-during-a-restart" name="managing-the-database-during-a-restart">
   Managing the database
during a restart
  </h2>
        <p>
   Signavio Process Manager works exclusively on database systems that
support transactions.
  </p>
        <p>
   Therefore, a
   <strong>
    restart
   </strong>
   of the database doesn't impact
data consistency. However, you must not abort the
   <strong>
    initialization
   </strong>
   of the server, because it includes
operations not all database system run in transactions. Therefore, you
   <strong>
    must not
   </strong>
   shut down the system during startup. In case
you need to shut down the database system,
   <strong>
    always shut down the
Tomcat server before
   </strong>.
  </p>
        <h2 id="managing-user-sessions-during-a-restart" name="managing-user-sessions-during-a-restart">
   Managing user sessions
during a restart
  </h2>
        <p>
   Every user session will be kept at a restart of the Tomcat server.
Therefore, users who are currently logged in stay logged in. Upon shut
down, the user sessions data is stored in a file on the Tomcat server
(by default <kbd>$TOMCAT_DIR/work/Catalina/localhost/\_/SESSIONS.ser</kbd>). The
system reads the file again during startup and restores the sessions.
If the system interrupt only lasts a short time, the modelers who are
currently logged in may not notice the restart at all. When users try
to save a diagram while the Tomcat server is down, they receive an
error message. As soon as the server is restarted, the save process can
be repeated and will succeed.
