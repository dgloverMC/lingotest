   Typical malfunctions
  </h1>
        <p>
   This section provides an overview over the most frequent causes for
system malfunctions and their possible solutions:
  </p>
        <dl>
            <dt><strong>
     The Tomcat server or the database don't start up after
maintenance activities.
    </strong>
            </dt>
            <dd>
                <p>
     Try to login each time after maintenance activities to check whether
the system started properly.
    </p>
            </dd>
            <dt><strong>
     Not enough disk space is available for the
database.
    </strong>
            </dt>
            <dd>
                <p>
     Each diagram version requires approximately 1 MB disc space. If a
diagram is saved ten times, 10 MB of data are used. We recommend
calculating enough disk space and monitoring it on operating system
level. For example, a note could be sent to the administrator if the
system is running out of disc space.
    </p>
            </dd>
            <dt><strong>
     There was not enough memory allocated to the Tomcat
server.
    </strong>
            </dt>
            <dd>
                <p>
     This manifests in frequent swapping and slow diagram accesses – even
     <code>OutOfMemoryExceptions</code>
     and a crash of the Tomcat server may
occur. Allocate more memory to the Tomcat server. See chapter
     <code class="interpreted-text" data-role="ref">
      conf_web_server
     </code>
     .
    </p>
            </dd>
            <dt><strong>
     Your browser redirects you to localhost when you enter the
Signavio server URL into the web browser.
    </strong>
            </dt>
            <dd>
                <p>
     You didn't configure the server correctly. Please ensure that the
installation instructions have been followed correctly and restart the
Apache Tomcat.
    </p>
            </dd>
            <dt><strong>
     Umlauts are not displayed as expected in Signavio Process
Manager UI and exported documents or pictures (PNG, PDF
etc.)
    </strong>
            </dt>
            <dd>
                <p>
     The Apache Tomcat is not using UTF-8 encoding. Please check the
operating system, database and web server configuration (see
installation instructions).
    </p>
            </dd>
            <dt><strong>
     The system doesn't send notification emails.
    </strong>
            </dt>
            <dd>
                <p>
     Re-check the server’s SMTP configuration (see installation
instructions).
    </p>
            </dd>
            <dt><strong>
     Users within your company/network receive notification
emails, external users don’t.
    </strong>
            </dt>
            <dd>
                <p>
     Some relay configuration of your email server prevents it from
sending emails to external users. For most email servers allowing
anonymous access (if no username and password was set during
configuration of the email server integration) this is the default
configuration. Contact the administrator who is responsible for your
email server.
    </p>
            </dd>
            <dt><strong>
     The Tomcat server doesn’t start up properly and writes
'Waiting for changelog lock...' into the log file.
    </strong>
            </dt>
            <dd>
                <p>
     If the Tomcat startup was canceled previously (for example due to a
lack of memory), this error may occur. Stop the server before fixing
the defect. Afterwards, log into the database and open the table
     <code>
      DatabaseChangelogLock
     </code>
     . It usually contains just one line.
Set the value of the variable
     <code>
      LOCKED
     </code>
     from
     <code>
      1
     </code>
     to
     <code>
      0
     </code>
     . Start the Tomcat server again.
    </p>
            </dd>
            <dt><strong>
     It is not possible to save very large
diagrams
    </strong>
            </dt>
            <dd>
                <p>
     With the default Tomcat settings, it is not possible to save very
large diagrams (&gt; 2 MB of mere textual representation). You can
increase the file size limit by adding the
     <code>
      maxPostSize
     </code>
     property to connector definitions in the Tomcat's
     <code>
      server.xml
     </code>
     file. Read more at
     <code class="interpreted-text" data-role="ref">
      conf_web_server
     </code>
     .
    </p>
            </dd>
            <dt><strong>
     Some features don't work as expected.
    </strong>
            </dt>
            <dd>
                <ul>
                    <li>
      The search of diagrams and Dictionary entries returns no
results.
     </li>
                    <li>
      The Dictionary is empty.
     </li>
                    <li>
      Diagrams can’t be exported as a PNGs, the diagram preview in the
explorer shows no picture of the diagram, the Collaboration Hub shows
no graphical representation and in the BPMN Simulation and Diagram
Comparison no diagrams are displyed.
     </li>
                    <li>
      The BPMN Simulation can’t be executed.

      No daily notifications are sent out.
     </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
     The different features are provided by different web services which
communicate via HTTP(S). For a smooth communication it is necessary
that the JVM instance accepts the used certificate. If you observe one
or more of these effects please check the Tomcat log files. Probably,
the error messages contain helpful hints on what the problem is.
