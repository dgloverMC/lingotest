   Accessing
Signavio Process Manager as a user
  </h1>
        <p>
   You access Signavio Process Manager with any modern web browser (see
   <a href="https://www.signavio.com/browser-compatibility/">
    https://www.signavio.com/browser-compatibility/
   </a>
   for a list of supported browsers).
  </p>
        <p>
   In case you have problems connecting to Signavio Process Manager,
make sure your browser's network and proxy settings are correct.
  </p>
        <p>
   To login to the Signavio web application you need to have a
registered user (and their email address and password).
  </p>
        <p>
   Collaboration Hub without single-sign-on allows any user who can
access the Signavio server's URL to view published diagrams in your
browser. If some users within your network shouldn't have access to
Collaboration Hub, you have to manage these access restrictions on
network level.
  </p>
        <p>
   In contrast, Collaboration Hub with single-sign-on allows you to
define user and group specific access rights for each diagram based on
your Active Directory service.
