   Monitoring
  </h1>
        <p>
   To avoid unnecessary downtime, you should continuously monitor both
the database server and the Tomcat server. For the database server it
is most important to monitor the used disc storage. You may set up an
observation routine that checks if the server runs out of disk space or
if there are problems with creating backups. If the database server
responds slowly, you should re-check its configuration (for example, if
the database caches are configured correctly or if the data needs to be
read from disk each time a request occurs).

        <p>
   You can check the plain availability of the Apache Tomcat server by
sending an
   <kbd>
    http
   </kbd>
   request and logging into the Signavio
system. Additionally, you should monitor the Tomcat server's process
and its memory usage. If the process has to touch the swap-section and
needs to outsource memory pages to the disc, the system responds very
slowly. In such a case, make further memory available.
