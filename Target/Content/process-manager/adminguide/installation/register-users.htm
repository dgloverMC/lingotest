   Registering users
  </h1>
        <p>
   To register a user, open the following URL in your browser:
  </p>
        <p><kbd>http://&lt;IP address or DNS of the Signavio
system&gt;/p/register</kbd>
        </p>
        <p>
   Fill out the form and click
   <strong>Register</strong>. Repeat this
step for each user you want to register. Users login by entering their
email address and a personally chosen password.
  </p>
        <div class="hint" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Hint&lt;/b&gt;">
            <p>
    A user’s email address is a unique ID. It is not possible to change
a user’s email address after its registration!
   </p>
        </div>
        <p>
   The first registered user is automatically added to the special user
group
   <strong>
    Administrators</strong>. You can add more users manually
to the group. Users who are member of the
   <strong>Administrators</strong>
   group operate with extended rights that
allow managing user groups or adding modeling guidelines. Therefore,
the first user is able to add other users to the administrators
group.
