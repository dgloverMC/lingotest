   As any web application, Signavio Process Manager depends on several
external software components. The administrator guide requires prior
knowledge about these components. The administrators responsible for
installing and maintaining the Signavio Process Manager need to be
proficient in the following technologies:
  </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
    The operating system you install the software on
   </li>
            <li>
    The database system you employ
   </li>
            <li>
    Oracle Java
   </li>
            <li>
    Apache Tomcat
   </li>
            <li>
    Setting up the connection to an email server
   </li>
            <li>
    If HTTPS is used, SSL/HTTPS
   </li>
            <li>
    If required, Microsoft Active Directory
   </li>
            <li>
    If required, Microsoft SharePoint Web Part
   </li>
        </ul>

     Information for customers of the Signavio Small Business
Edition
    </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
    The Signavio Small Business Edition (available until spring 2013)
has been provided with a pre-configured VMware image to simplify the
installation of Signavio Process Manager. However, operating and
maintaining the virtual machine is the responsibility of the customer.
Due to the further development of Signavio Process Manager, the
hardware requirements of the software have changed over the years.
Therefore, the pre-configured VMware image no longer fulfills the
requirements for operating Signavio Process Manager version 8.3.0 or
later. If you are using the pre-configured VMware image and you want to
update to version 8.3.0 or later, please migrate Signavio Process
Manager on a server infrastructure as explained in this document.
