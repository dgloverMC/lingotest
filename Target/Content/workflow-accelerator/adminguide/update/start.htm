  </h1>
        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
   When you have successfully installed the new Workflow Accelerator
version and verified that the configuration files are up-to-date, you
can restart the Workflow Accelerator system. Refer to chapter
   <MadCap:xref href="../start/intro.htm">
   Starting Signavio Workflow Accelerator
  </MadCap:xref>
   for more information on how to start Workflow Accelerator.
  </p>
        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
   During the first startup the Workflow Accelerator system will
migrate the database if there are any outstanding schema changes.
Therefore, the startup might take a short while depending on the size
of your database. If the system doesn't become available again within
minutes, please check the Workflow Accelerator log file for any new
error reports.
