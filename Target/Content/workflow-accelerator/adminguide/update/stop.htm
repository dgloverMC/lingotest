        <h1>Stop Workflow Accelerator</h1>
        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
   Before you can start with the update process you have to shutdown
the Workflow Accelerator system. It is sufficient when you shutdown the
Tomcat server Workflow Accelerator is running on. You don't have to
shutdown the MongoDB server. If you installed the Workflow Accelerator
Script Engine, you need to stop it as well. Refer to chapter <MadCap:xref href="../stop/stop.htm">
