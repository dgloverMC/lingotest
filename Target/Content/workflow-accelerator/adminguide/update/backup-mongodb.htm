   Updating Workflow Accelerator to a newer version might involve
changes in the database schema. Therefore, you are requested to backup
the database before you go on. See    <MadCap:xref href="../backup/backup.htm">
   Backup
  </MadCap:xref>
   for more information
on how to create a backup. Furthermore, the backup is necessary in case
you have to revert Workflow Accelerator to an older version, because
changes of the database schema are in general not backward compatible.
This means you cannot run an older version of Workflow Accelerator with
a database that was already migrated to a newer version.
