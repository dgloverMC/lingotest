   In case you purchased Workflow Accelerator along with Signavio
Process Manager and want to setup the integration, you don't have to
create the initial Workflow Accelerator user manually. See section <MadCap:xref href="#CreateInitialUser">Create the initial user
  </MadCap:xref>
   for more information.

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
   Workflow Accelerator users are organized in organizations. There is
a fadfadfaf dfasdf asfd maximum amount of organizations that can be registered on an
on-premise system. You will find the maximum number of available
organizations in your license file. When the initial user registers, he
will automatically create the first organization.
  </p>
        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
   In order to register, enter the URL of your Workflow Accelerator
installation in your browser. You will see the login screen of Workflow
Accelerator.

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
   Click
   <em>
    Register a new account
   </em>, fill in your email address
and click
   <em>
    Register a new user
   </em>. You will then receive an email
with a link to complete your registration. After you have done that,
your Workflow Accelerator organization is set up and you can go ahead
and invite more users.
  </p>
        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
   Every time a user registers using the register link on the login
screen, a new organization is created until the maximum amount is
reached. In general, you will create one organization and invite other
users to join this organization. The next subsection explains how to
invite users.
