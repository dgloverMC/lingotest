        <h1>Invite other users
  </h1>
        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
   In case this is an integrated installation with Signavio Process
Manager, see section<MadCap:xref href="../process-manager-integration/process-manager-integration.htm">
   Signavio Process Manager integration
  </MadCap:xref>
   for setting up
synchronization of users.
  </p>
        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
   To invite other users, go to the organization configuration panel.
That's located in the dropdown under your name in the top right corner
named
   <em>
    Organization settings
   </em>. In section Invitations you can
enter email addresses of users you want to invite. The amount of users
that can be invited to your organization depends on the number of user
licenses you have acquired. All organizations on an on-premise system
share the same license pool. This means the shown number of unused
licenses is the same in every organization. If one organization invites
another user the count of unused licenses in all organizations
decreases.
  </p>
        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
   A user can be invited to multiple organizations. If a user is part
of two organizations, he will require two user licenses, one for each
organization he is part of.
  </p>
        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
   Besides the manual invitation of every user, the enterprise version
of Workflow Accelerator offers the possibility to synchronize users and
groups with Active Directory. See <MadCap:xref href="../optional-configuration/synchronisation-active-directory.htm#User">User and group synchronisation with Active Directory</MadCap:xref>   for more information.</p>
