        <h1>Updating to Signavio Workflow 3.11</h1>
        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
   Effektif has been renamed to Signavio Workflow. Along with this
change, the colors of the default theme have changed as well. You may
notice the name of the database and database user in the examples in
this manual have been changed from <kbd>effektif</kbd>
   to <kbd>signavio</kbd>. You don't need to change any of the names in
your production environment. But keep in mind that you might have to
adjust any examples in this manual to your actual naming.
  </p>
        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
   With the new version of Signavio Workflow you are now able to
configure a Node.js server to execute script tasks in a workflow. Note,
you only need to configure this component if your version of Signavio
Workflow supports script tasks. In general, you can use script tasks
only with a full version of Signavio Workflow and not as part of the
Signavio Approval Workflow. Refer to section <MadCap:xref href="../install/install-script-engine.htm#InstallingWAScriptE">Installing the Workflow Accelerator
Script Engine
  </MadCap:xref>
   for more information on
how to setup the Signavio Workflow Script Engine.
  </p>
        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
   If you update from a version prior to Effektif 3.4, please follow
the instructions in the next section to update your Java, Tomcat and
MongoDB version as well. You don't need to do an intermediate update to
Effektif version 3.4 and can directly update to version 3.11 of
Signavio Workflow.
