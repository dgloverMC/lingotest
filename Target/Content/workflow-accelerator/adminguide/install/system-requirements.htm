   Operating system
  </h2>
        <p>
   The Workflow Accelerator system can be deployed on different
operating systems. Officially supported are the following operating
systems:
  </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
    Debian Stable Release 64-bit
   </li>
            <li>
    Microsoft Windows Server 64-bit
   </li>
        </ul>
        <div xmlns="" class="important" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Important&lt;/b&gt;">
            <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
    In general, it is possible to install Workflow Accelerator on other
Linux distributions. However, the installation process can differ from
the following instructions and the Signavio team cannot offer official
support in case of an installation problem.
   </p>
        </div>
        <p>
   You are advised to use a 64-bit operating system in order to be able
to assign more than 1.5 GB of heap space to the Java VM. Furthermore,
MongoDB is limited to 2 GB of content on 32-bit operating systems.
  </p>
        <h2 name="hardware-requirements">
   Hardware requirements
  </h2>
        <p>
   The described installation in this administrator's guide will set up
the database and the application server on the same system. However, it
is also possible to set up the database and application server on
separate systems. For instance, if you already have an infrastructure
that provides MongoDB instances for different applications, you can
simply reuse your infrastructure and just create another database for
Workflow Accelerator.
  </p>
        <p>
   The minimal hardware requirements for the combined system of
application and database server are:
  </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
    8 GB RAM
   </li>
            <li>
    4 core CPU
   </li>
            <li>
    50 GB disk space
   </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
   The required disk space depends on how you will use Workflow
Accelerator. 50 GB should be sufficient disk space for most scenarios.
However, if you plan on using a lot of file uploads in your processes
the required disk space depends largely on the number and size of the
uploaded files.
  </p>
        <p>
   Note that the required disk space does not include the space
necessary for backups. If you plan on storing the backups on the same
server, you should add more.
  </p>
        <h2 name="other-systems">
   Other systems
  </h2>
        <p>
   The Workflow Accelerator system relies on a SMTP mail server to send
notifications and invite users. You can simply reuse any existing mail
server in your organization that supports access via SMTP.
  </p>
        <h2 name="software-requirements">
   Software requirements
  </h2>
        <p>
   In order to run Workflow Accelerator on your server, you will need
to install some additional software. Depending on your deployment
strategy (combined or separate system for application and database),
you have to install the following required software either on the same
server or the respective separate servers.
  </p>
        <p>
   The following sections contain detailed instructions on how to
install and configure the additional software components.
  </p>
        <p>
   The application server requires the following additional
software:
  </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Java: Oracle JSE version 8 (1.8.0_66+)</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="important" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Important&lt;/b&gt;">
            <p>Pay attention to the version number. Signavio Workflow Accelerator
does not yet support Java 9.</p>
        </div>
        <ul>
            <li>
    Apache Tomcat 8.5 64-bit
   </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
   The database server requires the following additional software:
  </p>
        <li>
    MongoDB version 3.4.x or version 3.6.x
   </li>
        <p>
   The optional script engine requires the following additional
software:
  </p>
        <li>
    Node.js 8.x LTS
 </li>
        <div class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note&lt;/b&gt;">
            <p>We recommend updating to Node.js 10.x LTS. Only update to LTS versions.</p>
