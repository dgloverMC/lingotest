   Signavio Process Manager integration
  </h1>
        <p>
   The Signavio Process Manager integration with Signavio Workflow
Accelerator enables Process Manager users to execute approval workflows
for their process models using Workflow Accelerator. In order to setup
the integration properly, both systems, Process Manager and Workflow
Accelerator, have to be installed. For information about installing
Process Manager refer to Process Managers's adminstration manual. In
case both systems run on the same server, you need to set up two Tomcat
instances.
