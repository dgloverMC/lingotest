   If you have purchased the OEM version of Workflow Accelerator that
is shipped with Process Manager, user management will be handled by the
Process Manager system. The Process Manager system will synchronize all
users to Workflow Accelerator. Within Workflow Accelerator you will not
be able to register any initial user nor invite more users.
  </p>
        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
   If you have purchased a standalone version of Workflow Accelerator,
you will be able to create an initial user and invite more users to
Workflow Accelerator. However, we advise that you create your Workflow
Accelerator organization by activating the approval workflow feature in
Process Manager. This way, your Process Manager workspace and Workflow
Accelerator organization will be linked automatically.
