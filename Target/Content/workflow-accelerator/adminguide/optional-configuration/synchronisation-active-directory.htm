        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
   The enterprise version of Signavio Workflow Accelerator offers user
and group synchronisation with an Active Directory Server using the
LDAP V3 protocol.
  </p>
        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
   Before you can configure the synchronisation, check that you have
the following pre-requisites.
  </p>
        <ul xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
            <li>
    Workflow Accelerator is installed.
   </li>
            <li>
    The first Workflow Accelerator user is registered, see
    <MadCap:xref href="../start/create-initial-user.htm#CreateInitialUser">Create the initial user
  </MadCap:xref>.
   </li>
            <li>
    A domain account for querying the Active Directory - its username
and password.
   </li>
        </ul>
        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
   Configuring the synchronisation consists of the following steps.
  </p>
        <ol xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
            <li>
    Create an Active Directory group that contains all Workflow
Accelerator users as members.
   </li>
            <li>
    Create an Active Directory group that contains all Workflow
Accelerator administrators as members.
   </li>
            <li>
    (Optional) Create an Active Directory group that contains all
groups as members.
   </li>
            <li>
    Log in to Workflow Accelerator with your initial user.
   </li>
            <li>
    Open the
    <em>
     Organization settings
    </em>
    and select the
    <em>
     LDAP
    </em>
    tab.
   </li>
            <li>
    Create a new Active Directory configuration.
   </li>
            <li>
    Validate your configuration.
   </li>
            <li>
    Synchronise the users and groups.
   </li>
        </ol>
        <h2 name="creating-the-active-directory-groups" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
   Creating the Active
Directory groups
  </h2>
        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
   Active Directory users and groups that should be synchronised with
Workflow Accelerator are managed within Active Directory by adding them
to specific Active Directory groups. There are two groups for users,
one which contains all Workflow Accelerator users and one which
contains only administrators. All members of the administrator group
must be members of the user group as well. Nested groups are not
supported. All users and administrators need to be direct members of
their groups.
  </p>
        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
The synchronisation will copy the attributes <kbd>givenName</kbd>, <kbd>sn</kbd>, <kbd>mail</kbd>, <kbd>dn</kbd>, <kbd>objectGUID</kbd>, <kbd>sAMAccountName</kbd> and <kbd>userPrincipalName</kbd> to the user in Workflow Accelerator. It is required that every user has the <kbd>mail</kbd> attribute defined. 
  </p>
        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
   Optionally, you can define a third group that contains all Active
Directory groups that should be synchronised. All members of this group
should be Active Directory groups as well. Again nested groups are not
supported. Users must be direct members of the synchronised groups. The
synchronisation will copy the attributes
<kbd>cn</kbd>, <kbd>dn</kbd> and <kbd>objectGUID</kbd>
   to the group in Workflow
Accelerator. Every group member that is not a Workflow Accelerator user
will be ignored.

configuration. Enter the configuration details on the configuration

   Validating a configuration
  </h2>
        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
   Before synchronisation can start, the configuration must be
validated. Validation includes the following checks.
  </p>
        <ul xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
            <li>
    Workflow Accelerator can connect to the Active Directory.
   </li>
            <li>
    The configured groups are proper Active Directory groups.
   </li>
            <li>
    There is at least one user.
   </li>
            <li>
    There is at least one administrator.
   </li>
            <li>
    The users have the
<kbd>mail</kbd>
    attribute defined.
   </li>
            <li>
    There are sufficient licenses.
   </li>
            <li>
    (Optional) There are groups defined.
   </li>
        </ul>
        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
   Start the validation by selecting
   <em>
    Validate
   </em>. If the
configuration is valid, the
   <em>
    Synchronise
   </em>
   button is enabled. If
the configuration is not valid, the page shows a list with more
detailed information. In that case fix the issues and run the
validation again.
  </p>
        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
   Every time you change the configuration, the validation must be
executed again.
  </p>
        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
   Note the validation might take several seconds depending on the
number of users you want to synchronise and the perfomance of the
Active Directory server.

        <h2 name="synchronising-users-and-groups" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
   Synchronising users and
groups
  </h2>
        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
   If the configuration is valid, you can synchronise the users and
groups. Start the synchronisation by clicking on
   <em>
    Synchronise
   </em>.
If the synchronisation was successful, you will see a report of the
added / updated users and groups. If the synchronisation failed, a list
with more detailed information will be shown.
  </p>
        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
   Note the synchronisation might take several seconds or minutes
depending on the number of users you want to synchronise and the
perfomance of the Active Directory.
